Such a set is called an “environmental event”. The machine learning algorithm uses information about the frequency of environmental events to support learning. If we want to study statistical machine learning, then we must be able to discuss how to represent and compute the probability of an environmental event. It is essential that we have methods for communicating probability concepts to other researchers, methods for calculating probabilities, and methods for calculating the expectation of specific environmental events. This episode discusses the challenges of assigning probabilities to events when we allow for the case of events comprised of an infinite number of outcomes. Along the way we introduce essential concepts for representing and computing probabilities using measure theory mathematical tools such as sigma fields, and the Radon-Nikodym probability density function. Near the end we also briefly discuss the intriguing Banach-Tarski paradox and how it motivates the development of some of these special mathematical tools.

In particular, a broad class of unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement machine learning algorithms which iteratively update their parameter vector by adding a perturbation based upon all of the training data. This process is repeated, making a perturbation of the parameter vector based upon all of the training data until a parameter vector is generated which exhibits improved predictive performance. The magnitude of the perturbation at each learning iteration is called the “stepsize” or “learning rate” and the identity of the perturbation vector is called the “search direction”. Simple mathematical formulas are presented based upon research from the late 1960s by Philip Wolfe and G. Zoutendijk that ensure convergence of the generated sequence of parameter vectors. These formulas may be used as the basis for the design of artificially intelligent smart automatic learning rate selection algorithms. The material in this podcast is designed to provide an overview of Chapter 7 of my new book “Statistical Machine Learning” and is based upon material originally presented in Episode 68 of Learning Machines 101!

First, we discuss the importance of building common sense into learning machines. Second, we discuss how first-order logic can be used to represent common sense knowledge. Third, we describe a large database of common sense knowledge where the knowledge is represented using first-order logic which is free for researchers in machine learning. We provide a hyperlink to this free database of common sense knowledge. Fourth, we discuss some problems of first-order logic and explain how these problems can be resolved by transforming logical rules into probabilistic rules using Markov Logic Nets. And finally, we have another book review of the book “Markov Logic: An Interface Layer for Artificial Intelligence” by Pedro Domingos and Daniel Lowd which provides further discussion of the issues in this podcast. In this book review, we cover some additional important applications of Markov Logic Nets not covered in detail in this podcast such as: object labeling, social network link analysis, information extraction, and helping support robot navigation. Finally, at the end of the podcast we provide information about a free software program which you can use to build and evaluate your own Markov Logic Net!

We discuss the concept of recognizing facial emotions in images including applications to problems such as: improving online communication quality, identifying suspicious individuals such as terrorists using video cameras, improving lie detector tests, improving athletic performance by providing emotion feedback, and designing smart advertising which can look at the customer’s face to determine if they are bored or interested and dynamically adapt the advertising accordingly. To address this problem we review clustering algorithm methods including K-means clustering, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Spectral Clustering, and the relatively new technique of Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (SNE) clustering. At the end of this podcast we provide a brief review of the classic machine learning text by Christopher Bishop titled “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning”.

This process is repeated, making a perturbation of the parameter vector based upon all of the training data until a parameter vector is generated which exhibits improved predictive performance. The magnitude of the perturbation at each learning iteration is called the “stepsize” or “learning rate” and the identity of the perturbation vector is called the “search direction”. Simple mathematical formulas are presented based upon research from the late 1960s by Philip Wolfe and G. Zoutendijk that ensure convergence of the generated sequence of parameter vectors. These formulas may be used as the basis for the design of artificially intelligent smart automatic learning rate selection algorithms.

There are too many papers out there already. Definitely an exciting area, be it optimisation, integration, differential equations. I chose this paper because it seems to have blown the field open to a wider audience, focussing as it did on deep learning as an application, so it let's me capture both an area of developing interest and an area that hits the national news.\n\n\n\n\nKernel Bayes Rule by Fukumizu, Song, Gretton\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5736\n\nOne of the great things about ML is how we have different (and competing) philosophies operating under the same roof. But because we still talk to each other (and sometimes even listen to each other)  these ideas can merge to create new and interesting things. Kernel Bayes Rule makes the list.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/imagenet.pdf\n\nAn obvious choice, but you don't leave the Beatles off lists of great bands just because they are an obvious choice.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.", "published_date": "2019-02-15T01:11:22Z", "link": "https://omny.fm/shows/talking-machines/real-world-real-time-and-five-papers-for-mike-tipp", "image": "https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/b92baa3c-b9c8-488c-aa9e-aafd001cbf66/12abbc3c-ae53-487a-b83b-aafd001cbf79/image.jpg?t=1573004683&size=Large", "podcast_name": "Talking Machines", "guid": "gid://art19-episode-locator/V0/ku7-PCs6_7lQP8OuPzVga5DZL1jlI7Drllq-9LCQlX8"}}, {"model": "podcasts.episode", "pk": 2226, "fields": {"title": "The Bezos Paradox and Machine Learning Languages", "category": 6, "description": "In episode two of season five we unpack the Bezos Paradox (TM Neil Lawrence) take a listener question about best papers and chat with Dougal Maclaurin of Google Brain.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.", "published_date": "2019-02-01T03:12:56Z", "link": "https://omny.fm/shows/talking-machines/the-bezos-paradox-and-machine-learning-languages", "image": "https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/b92baa3c-b9c8-488c-aa9e-aafd001cbf66/12abbc3c-ae53-487a-b83b-aafd001cbf79/image.jpg?t=1573004683&size=Large", "podcast_name": "Talking Machines", "guid": "gid://art19-episode-locator/V0/n6ZPQRWryHqfXqwSG11WlInPjOa3863Q2sYGLcqWS14"}}, {"model": "podcasts.episode", "pk": 2227, "fields": {"title": "104 - Mossy Walls", "category": 5, "description": "Hilary and Roger give some updates on what’s going on and how life at home is working out.

We reached out to Nature for a statement on the statement and received the following:\n\n“At Springer Nature we are very clear in our mission to advance discovery and help researchers share their work. Having an extensive, and growing, open access portfolio is one important way we do this but it is important to remember that while open access has been around for 20 years now it still only accounts for a small percentage of overall global research output with demand for subscription content remaining high. This is because the move to open access is complex, and for many, simply not a viable option.\n\nNature Machine Intelligence is a new subscription journal that aims to stimulate cross-disciplinary interactions, reach broad audiences and explore the impact that AI research has on other fields by publishing high-quality research, reviews and commentary on machine learning, robotics and AI. It involves substantial editorial development, offers high levels of author service and publishes informative, accessible content beyond primary research all of which requires considerable investment. At present, we believe that the fairest way of producing highly selective journals like this one and ensuring their long-term sustainability as a resource for the widest possible community, is to spread these costs among many readers — instead of having them borne by a few authors.   \n\n We also offer multiple open access options for AI authors. We already publish AI papers in Scientific Reports and Nature Communications, which are the largest open access journal in the world and the most cited open access journal respectively. We offer hybrid publishing options and are set to launch a new AI multidisciplinary, open access journal later this year.\n\nWe help all researchers to freely share their discoveries by encouraging preprint posting and data- and code-sharing and continue to extend access to all Nature journals in various ways, including our free SharedIt content-sharing initiative, which provides authors and subscribers with shareable links to view-only versions of published papers.”\n\nWe also get a chance to talk with Maithra Raghu from the Google Brain team about her work. \n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.", "published_date": "2018-05-31T21:32:53Z", "link": "https://omny.fm/shows/talking-machines/statements-on-statements", "image": "https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/b92baa3c-b9c8-488c-aa9e-aafd001cbf66/12abbc3c-ae53-487a-b83b-aafd001cbf79/image.jpg?t=1573004683&size=Large", "podcast_name": "Talking Machines", "guid": "gid://art19-episode-locator/V0/Qwq6hbvBwAfDc0yxneU3gZ_u6jK2W1BvL9kY6y6IK9U"}}, {"model": "podcasts.episode", "pk": 2265, "fields": {"title": "SDS 538: Daily Habit #1: Track Your Habits", "category": 5, "description": "In this episode, Jon shares his \"life-changing\" habit tracking system that has allowed him to achieve more, create more structure within his day and cut out bad habits. \n\nAdditional materials: www.superdatascience.com/538", "published_date": "2022-01-07T12:00:12Z", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience/sds-538-daily-habit-1-track-your-habits", "image": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-0xZp92Dc5bypilfg-1nXWDg-original.jpg", "podcast_name": "Super Data Science", "guid": "tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/1191300943"}}, {"model": "podcasts.episode", "pk": 2266, "fields": {"title": "87 - Leadership Skills for the Apocalypse", "category": 5, "description": "Hilary and Roger go behind the scenes of a new tool for building outfits that she helped build at Stitch Fix.

The global group behavior is an “emergent property” of local interactions among individuals in the group! We will analyze the concept of swarm intelligence as a Markov Random Field, discuss how it can be harnessed to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms, and comment upon relevant mathematics for analyzing and designing “swarm intelligences” so they behave in an appropriate manner by viewing the Swarm as a nonlinear optimization algorithm.

Suppose that you are teaching a student a particular target set of knowledge. Examples of such situations obviously occur in nursery school, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and college. However, such situations also occur in industry when top professionals in a particular field attend an advanced training seminar. All of these situations would benefit from a smart adaptive assessment machine which attempts to estimate a student’s knowledge in real-time. Such a machine could then use that information to optimize the choice and order of questions to be presented to the student in order to develop a customized exam for efficiently assessing the student’s knowledge level and possibly guiding instructional strategies.

Welcome to the thirteenth podcast in the podcast series Learning Machines 101. In this series of podcasts my goal is to discuss important concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning in hopefully an entertaining and educational manner.\n \n \nIn this episode we will explain how to download and use free machine learning software which can be downloaded from the website: www.learningmachines101.com. Although we will continue to focus on critical theoretical concepts in machine learning in future episodes, it is always useful to actually experience how these concepts work in practice. For these reasons, from time to time I will include special podcasts like this one which focus on very practical issues associated with downloading and installing machine learning software on your computer. If you follow these instructions, by the end of this episode you will have installed one of the simplest (yet most widely used) machine learning algorithms on your computer. You can then use the software to make virtually any kind of prediction you like. However, some of these predictions will be good predictions, while other predictions will be poor predictions. For this reason, following the discussion in Episode 12 which was concerned with the problem of evaluating generalization performance, we will also discuss how to evaluate what your learning machine has “memorized” and additionally evaluate the ability of your learning machine to “generalize” and make predictions about things that it has never seen before.", "published_date": "2014-09-22T22:46:14Z", "link": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/learningmachines101/LM101-013.mp3", "image": "https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/c/2/f/9/c2f9c0461c2b3753/CoverArt1400by1400-Nov2019.jpg", "podcast_name": "Learning Machines 101", "guid": "b72064f978d5e24e88393c3735a742cc"}}, {"model": "podcasts.episode", "pk": 2717, "fields": {"title": "SDS 442: Data Science as an Atomic Habit", "category": 5, "description": "In today’s episode, I discuss how focusing on process and habit building can provide more for you and your professional progress than simply chasing a goal.\n\nAdditional materials: www.superdatascience.com/442", "published_date": "2021-02-05T13:00:28Z", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience/sds-442-data-science-as-an-atomic-habit", "image": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-0xZp92Dc5bypilfg-1nXWDg-original.jpg", "podcast_name": "Super Data Science", "guid": "tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/978814240"}}, {"model": "podcasts.episode", "pk": 2718, "fields": {"title": "SDS 441: Communicating Data Effectively", "category": 5, "description": "Kate Strachnyi joins us to discuss her work in data visualization education from conferences to published books as well as her tips for visualization best practices.\n\nIn this episode you will learn:\n• What does Kate do (from her children’s perspective) [1:56]\n• What kind of tools does Kate employ?

This episode, we interview Brooke Wenig, the machine learning practice lead at Databricks. Databricks was founded by the folks who created Apache Spark. Those of you who are technically savvy with AI will be familiar with Apache Spark as an open source language for artificial intelligence and distributed computing. Wenig works with a lot of companies with Databricks. Databricks is now close to 700 folks and helps implement AI applications into, oftentimes, large enterprise environments. Wenig speaks with us this week about what to look for in an actual data scientist and how to find data science folks with the right skills to be able to communicate to business people, not just to work with models. What should people be capable of; how should they be capable of thinking? Hopefully, some of you will have better interview questions by the end of this podcast.

These are just things on the technology road map, but people speak about them like they exist now. This week, we speak with Abinash Tripathy, founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Help Shift. They've raised upwards of $40,000,000 in the last six years to apply artificial intelligence to the future of  customer service, and we speak about the hard challenges of  chatbots and conversational interfaces, as well as how long it's going to be until those are actually robust. This in opposition to how people at large companies might put out a press release touting their own chatbots that simply aren't capable of doing what they say they can to any meaningful degree. We also talk about where AI can augment and make a difference in existing customer service workflows.  Even if we can't have all-capable chatbots to handle banking or  insurance or  eCommerce questions from people, where can AI easily slide it's way in and actually make a difference today? In this episode, we draw a firm line on where the technology currently stands. Overall, though, this episode is about the challenges of actually innovating in AI. We talk about why it really is the big companies that do a lot of the actual cutting edge breakthroughs of AI and why others are going to have to license those their technologies from large firms like Google and Amazon.

The company claims to help retailers with inventory optimization, and we speak with Alejandro about how artificial intelligence can be used to search the web for the product clusters and individual products of major retailers to help inform other retailers on what products might be popular. There are two primary takeaways from this episode. The first is the broad capability of monitoring the competition with artificial intelligence, something that can be applied across industries, not just in retail. The second is that EDITED is generating information from what is freely available on the web, and so it would seem their software doesn't require businesses to integrate it into inventory management systems in order to train the algorithm behind it. I'm not necessarily lauding the company; I haven't used their product nor read all of their case studies. That said, it's worth noting simply because its approach is fundamentally different than most AI vendors.

How do we instrument a physical retail space so that, with cameras, we can pick up on the same kind of metrics that eCommerce stores can? Retail stores, as Reddy talks about in this episode, have to focus on the data that they get from the checkout counter, such as what kind of purchases were made, and potentially some kind of data about how many times the front door was opened or closed. That doesn’t really lay out that much detail about who came in, what percent of them converted, and what the average cart value was for different people. A lot of that is completely greyed out when looking at the numbers that are accessible to brick and mortar retailers. But some of that is changing. Reddy talks about what’s possible now with machine vision in retail, and what it opens up in terms of possibility spaces for understanding customers better in a physical environment.

A typical B2B company might at most make a couple hundred sales per year, and many B2B companies make only dozens. In other words, every sale matters. In this episode of the AI in Industry podcast, we interview Kiran Rama, Director of Data Sciences Center of Excellence at VMWare, about purchasing external data and to leveraging internal data. Rama also talks about using data to determine how likely certain leads are to turn into high-value customers.

Much of our own research and  conversations with machine learning vendors and the consultants trying to sell AI into the enterprise actually think there's another, bigger problem: combing the expertise of subject matter experts and that of data scientists to leverage information for future initiatives in business. This week, we interview Grant Wernick, CEO of Insight Engines in San Francisco.

One of those companies is Fractal Analytics. Fractal Analytics works in a number of spaces. One of them, consumer packaged goods, is an area on which we haven’t done much coverage. Many of our readers are in the retail space, but CPG has some pretty curious AI use cases. This week, we interview Prashant Joshi, Head of AI and Machine Learning at Fractal Analytics, about the different applications of machine learning in the CPG sector: doing chemical tests or finding new buyer segments within existing groups of consumers to determine who is buying from a company and who is buying from competitors.

There are so many ways that a customer can interact with a business and it is important to take them all into account. Customers or prospects who interact via chat may represent just one segment of the audience, while the people that engage via the call center represent another segment of the audience. The same might be said of social media channels like Twitter and Facebook. Each channel may offer a unique perspective from customers – and may provide unique value for business leaders eager to improve their customer experience. Understanding and addressing all channels of unstructured text feedback is a major focus for natural language processing applications in business – and it’s a major focus for Luminoso. Luminoso founder  Catherine Havasi received her Master’s degree in natural language processing from MIT in 2004, and went on to graduate with a PhD in computer science from Brandeis before returning to MIT as a Research Scientist and Research Affiliate. She founded Luminoso in 2011. In this article, we ask Catherine about the use cases of NLP for understanding customer voice – and the circumstances where this technology can be most valuable for companies.

This week we interview Allan Benchetrit, CEO at Algolux - a Montreal-based AI company focusing on computational imaging. If you take an image for a human being in a consumer application (maybe an iPhone app or a recreational DSLR camera), you probably want it to be visually appealing and clear to the human eye. As it turns out, machines don't need pretty images, they need to do their jobs. If a computer vision system needs to detect road signs, or suspicious people in an airport, or the presence of weeds in a cornfield - it may create images that are ugly to the human eye, but perfectly calibrated for being interpreted by machines for their jobs. As it turns out, this is a complicated AI-related problem itself, and Allan walks us through it.

Al-Rodhan spent decades studying the human mind, and it helped him form a theory of humanity, its nature, and its technological future. Namely, that our very nature will inevitably bring us to go beyond nature - not merely in the extension of our capacities through devices - but through a literal enhancement and extension of our bodies and minds.\n \nIn his belief, human beings are emotional creatures with a moral compass that exists for their own egotistical needs. Our desire for power, profit, pleasure, pride and permanency - says Neyef - will drive us beyond the bounds of our physical condition, and it's the role of governments (not corporations) to regulate that process of enhancement and experimentation for the good of humanity. If you're interested in human motivation and the next 20 years of enhancement technology, this is an interview you won't want to miss.", "published_date": "2015-06-07T19:00:00Z", "link":

Ingram’s mother was misdiagnosed with a brain aneurism and placed on bed rest for two years - a problem that likely resulted from a typo or similar minor error. Tracy founded BioscanR to help turn biological information from patients into more reliable diagnostic data for doctors, and he competed with his idea in the Qualcomm X-Prize.\nIn this interview, Tracy talks about three reasons why healthcare is often slower to adopt new technologies, as well as his predictions about the coming 10 years of healthcare progress and the innovations that he believes may be most useful for patients and physicians alike.", "published_date": "2015-05-17T19:00:00Z", "link":

ago, Cornell’s Dr. Joe Halpern wrote a book called “Reasoning with Uncertainty.” In this interview, we discuss alternatives approaches to handling large scale uncertainty - as might be applied to broad concerns such as environmental policy, or the management of hard-to-previct emerging technologies.\n \nThrough thought experiments and some philosophical exploration, Prof. Halpern explains some potential alternatives to “probabilities,” and opens up the door to other, potentially more robust methods of managing large, uncertain, important questions for humanity’s future.", "published_date":

Jill Bolte Taylor became remarkably well-known following her TED talk called “My stroke of insight,” where she explained her experience of having a stroke from her perspective… that is to say: perspective of a neuroscientist. Since then Jill has been featured on Oprah, and her book (with the same title as her TED talk) is available in over 30 languages worldwide.\nIn this interview, Dr. Taylor explains her perspective on the place and purpose of the left and right hemispheres, and how an understanding of neuroanatomy might help us make sense of our own desires / drives, and help us lead a more fulfilling or productive

Istvan doesn’t believe that issues of life extension, genetic modification, and neural prosthetics are the problems for the president in the year 220, but that they’re among the most important considerations of the future of America, and of human life in general.\nIn this interview, I ask Zoltan what kinds of technology and health initiatives he’d get behind as a president, as well as his own thoughts as to how concerns of merging technology might be brought to the forefront of American awareness (without a disaster, that is).", "published_date": "2015-02-22T20:00:00Z", "link":

called “transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS),” haven’t you heard about it? The process involves zapping your brain through subtle electrical stimulation on the outside of the head - and though research has been going on in this field for decades, the mechanisms for it’s effects on mood, memory, and more, are still mostly unknown.\nDr. Brent Williams  is the director of the iTeach Center at KSU, and he landed in WIRED magazine for some of his work on tDCS. In this episode, he talks about the potential future of tCDS to enhance normal human function and potentially allow us more control over our emotional state and mental performance, as the technology progresses. It’s enough to make you want to go to Radio Shack and build one yourself.", "published_date": "2015-01-25T20:00:00Z", "link": "http://podcast.emerj.com/a-zap-to-the-head-might-do-us-all-some-good-talking-brain-stimulation-with-dr-brent-williams", "image": "https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/1/c/0/2/1c02772256d769adbafc7308ab683e82/The_AI_in_business_new_Blue_32x.jpeg", "podcast_name": "The AI in Business Podcast", "guid": "c9c9e5a529644a7135effaff8a62cc1b"}}, {"model": "podcasts.episode", "pk": 3587, "fields": {"title": "Swarm Robots - When Will They Enter Society?

James McLurkin works with swarm robots at Rice University, and his unique work on robot communication has landed him on PBS’s “Nova,” in addition to speaking engagements at events like TED and Singularity Summit.\nIn this episode, Dr. McLurkin discusses how swarm robots have been inspired by insect behavior - and exactly swamp robots are best suited for. In many cases, argues McLurkin, a group of smaller, inexpensive robots can perform a job much better than a single, more capable robot. Dr. James also sheds light on when and how swarm robots might become a part of everyday life and industry in the coming decades.", "published_date": "2015-01-18T20:00:00Z", "link":

Brin is recognized as one of the most iconic futurist fiction writers of our time. With huge bestsellers like “The Postman” (later turned into a movie starring Kevin Costner), David’s work explores the ramifications of human choices of our collective future.\n \nIn this interview, David talks about fiction’s unique role in helping humanity find a beneficial future - a job done in large part by pointing out what we want to avoid most, says David. If you’re an entrepreneur, researcher, or writer yourself, David’s insights into “imagination” as a force for good are important to listen closely to.", "published_date": "2015-01-11T20:00:00Z",

Kopper runs the Duke Immersive Virtual Environment, or “DiVE.” His research focuses on the interactions of virtual and real humans. In this interview, he discusses his predictions for the non-gaming applications of virtual reality - and the surprising evidence that virtual reality humans might “relate” to us in much the way that real humans do. What happens when we can’t tell the difference?\n\n \n  Normal\n  0\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  false\n  false\n  false\n  \n  EN-US\n  X-NONE\n  X-NONE\n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n

is project head at Birdly, one of virtual reality’s most curious projects. Birdly is a full-body kind of “table” that one lays upon while wearing an Oculus VR headset - and through a combination of arm control (to replicate wings) and fan (to replicate the speed of air in one’s face) - reproduces the experience of flying like a giant hawk.\nIn this episode, I ask Max about the components of a truly “immersive” VR experience, and about his predictions about the coming decade in VR technology.\nFor More Information, Visit the HUB of Startups / Business in Emerging Technology.

It guides you through a series of questions and visuals to all you to see for yourself what correlates (spoiler: carbon emissions) and what does not.\n\nOn the show we talk about how the Bloomberg team came up with this piece, their interaction with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) scientists who developed the model, and the many challenges of translating important scientific knowledge into more digestible, but not simplistic, articles that everyone can read.\n\nWe also talk about how they took inspiration from the children book \"Where's Spot?\" (which is a nice narrative technique for vis!) and all the delicate design decisions they had to make.\n\n...
